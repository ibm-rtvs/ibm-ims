These are functionally identical to \r\nthe samples shipped as part of  **IMS Enterprise Suite Connect APIs for Java** other than the host &amp; port can be specified on the command line.  \r\n\r\n \r\n- A RIT project which contains\r\n\t- A test suite to run the IVTNO transaction\r\n\t- A stub which simulates the IVTNO transaction\r\n\t- COBOL copybooks defining the input and output structure on the IVTNO messages.\r\n\t- Monitor definitions for the relevant operations.\r\n  \r\n## Post download instructions\r\n\r\nAfter download of the project, the folder structure for the ibm-ims is:\r\n\r\n    ibm-ims\r\n        rit-projects\r\n            rit-project-ibm-ims.zip\r\n        applications\r\n            client\r\n               IMSESConnectAPIJava\r\n               startSimplePhonebookSample.bat\r\n                             \r\n- Unzip rit-projects/rit-project-ibm-ims.zip. This contains a RIT project ibm-ims.ghp\r\n- Download the required **IMS Enterprise Suite Connect APIs for Java** libraries\r\n from [www.ibm.com/software/data/ims/connect/](www.ibm.com/software/data/ims/connect/) and \r\n unzip into the ibm-ims/applications/client/IMSESConnectAPIJava folder.                \r\n\r\n## Configuring the RIT project to match your IMS environment\r\n\r\nThe RIT project's *Production* environment has been configured to an IMS system on ims1.company.com:9999. You need to modify the project settings\r\nto refer to your own IMS system. \r\n\r\n- Start RIT.\r\n- Select Open, then navigate to the ibm-ims/ibm-ims.ghp file. \r\n- Go to \"Architecture School\" (F9).\r\n- Select \"Physical View\" tab\r\n- Open **ims1**\r\n- Change hostname and port to match your IMS server settings\r\n- Verify connection by using the \"Test Transport\" button, then select **OK**\r\n- Select **OK** to save changes.\r\n\r\n![TransportSettings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-rtvs/ibm-ims/master/TransportSettings.png \"Configuring to use your own IMS system\")\r\n \r\n## Running the sample Simple phonebook application\r\n- Open a command prompt.\r\n- Change directory to ibm-ims/applications/client.\r\n- Run startSimplePhonebookSample.bat *hostname* *port* *datastorename*.\r\n\r\n![SimpleSample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-rtvs/ibm-ims/master/SimpleSample.png \"Output from the SimpleSample app\")\r\n\r\nA trace log SimplePhonebookSampleTrace.log is created by IMS Connect\r\n\r\n## Intercepting the sample phonebook application flows\r\n- Modify the HTTP/TCP proxy service configuration file httptcp/registration.xml by adding the following line:\r\n\r\n  &lt;forward bind=\"localhost:2002\" destination=\"*hostname*:*port*\" type=\"ims\" /&gt;\r\n\r\n- Stop, re-start the HTTP/TCP proxy service. Now, IMS traffic directed to localhost:2002 will be directed to *hostname*:*port*\r\n- Re-run application, redirecting traffic through the intercept\r\n \r\n  startSimplePhonebookSample.bat localhost 2002 *datastorename*.\r\n\r\n![SimpleSampleProxy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-rtvs/ibm-ims/master/SimpleSampleProxy.png \"Output from the SimpleSample app, run via the intercept\")\r\n  \r\n\r\n## Recording the sample phonebook application\r\n- Start RIT.\r\n- Select Open, then navigate to the ibm-ims/ibm-ims.ghp file. \r\n- Go to \"Recording Studio\" (F9).\r\n- In the Events Monitors window import monitors from file *monitors.rsh*. \r\n- Select *Record*.\r\n- Open a command prompt.\r\n- Change directory to ibm-ims/applications/client.\r\n- Re-run application, redirecting traffic through the intercept\r\n \r\n  startSimplePhonebookSample.bat localhost 2002 *datastorename*.\r\n  \r\n- Using the application will results in operations being shown in the Events View window of RIT.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-55174336-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
